ICALCS are the computers which DEM offers to students and professors. These computers have the licensing for software that might not run smoothly on personal computers and have licensing for software not available to everyone. Professors and students connect to these computers via **Remote Desktop** with their User account.

**Rule of thumb:** No one is allowed to store their files inside these computers. All users have a separate folder for their files on a mapped drive in the network.

Here is a look at the current state at each ICALC and their respective software installed.
