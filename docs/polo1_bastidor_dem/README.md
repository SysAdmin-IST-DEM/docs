Polo1 is where the ICALC computers mentioned in the [ICALCS]() section of this documentation are located. The need to go to this room is limited to the situations discussed in the Common Requests and Common Problems.

## Common Requests

You will not (or almost never) get a request/ticket to perform something on Polo1. However if a new computer ICALC needs to be installed you need to install every software appointed by the teatcher and secure the PC amongst the others.

## Common Problems

#### Connection Issues

From time to time its good to have check if all the ICALC's are working correctly, you can easily check this by joining all computers through Remote Desktop. If one or more are not connecting because of an error, it might be better to head to Polo1 and restart the PC, this usually fixes the problem.
